I'm a tinkerer.  A perfectionist.  The kind of person who spends days optimizing their computer setup just to save themselves a couple of seconds here or there later down the line.

I do this not in the hope of ever recouping the time that I've put into these projects.  No, it's more about having the ability to do more *in the moment*.  I'm spending time now to make sure that when I want to do something later I can do it  *instantly*, *flawlessly*,Â and - most important of all - *without distracting me from what I'm actually concentrating on*.  That is an optimized system.

Either that, or I just love tinkering.

And I love _sharing_ my tinkering.  But until now, I've not really had a good place to put that kind of thing online.  So this got me thinking...how about a new blog?

And here we are.
