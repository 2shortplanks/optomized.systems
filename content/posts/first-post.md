I'm a tinkerer. A perfectionist. The kind of person who spends days optimizing
their computer setup just to save themselves a couple of seconds here or there
later down the line.

I do this not in the hope of ever recouping the time that I've put into these
projects. No, it's more about having the ability to do more _in the moment_. I'm
spending time now to make sure that when I want to do something later I can do
it _instantly_, _flawlessly_, and - most important of all - _without distracting
me from what I'm actually concentrating on_. That is an optimized system.

Either that, or I just love tinkering.

And I love _sharing_ my tinkering. But until now, I've not really had a good
place to put that kind of thing online. So this got me thinking...how about a
new blog?

And here we are.
